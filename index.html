        <h2>It all starts with the perfect bean</h2>
        <p>With coffee production under threat from climate change and disease, 
            the future of coffee depends on high-quality beans. Within R&D <a href="https://www.nestle.com/randd/sustainability" target="_blank">we 
            invest in plant science</a>, to understand the biology of coffee to develop drought 
            and disease-resistant varieties. For this, we use traditional GMO-free 
            propagation methods and valorize local coffee varieties. Through our research we 
            even rediscovered the first coffee varieties ever cultivated by mankind and 
            revived them in our Nespresso special editions.</p>
        <p>Under the global <a href="https://www.nestle.com/stories/international-coffee-day-nescafe-launched-grown-respectfully" target="_blank">Nescafé Plan</a>, 
            Nestlé will have supported farmers across the world 
            with 220 million new coffee plantlets by the end of 2020. This allows them to renovate 
            plantations, improve crop quality and productivity, and – on the most vital,
            human level – make coffee farming profitable.</p>

        <p>With these aims in mind, we've obtained the first generation of hybrid Arabica <img id="intext" src="/images/coffee-plant.jpg" alt="coffee plants">
            trees able to be propagated by seeds. These exclusive varieties are adaptable across a wide range of environments 
            and have a shorter breeding period. They produce coffees of an outstanding quality, with a 40% 
            higher yield, and demand less water – a crucial trait in rain-scarce regions – and fertilizer. 
            We are harnessing this breakthrough  to develop new coffee varieties for Nespresso and our 
            out-of-home coffee business Nestlé Professional. We are also innovating at the post-harvest stage, 
            to create special flavors and aromas through a more controlled fermentation of beans, a natural 
            process during coffee production.</p>

                <h2>The art of roasting</h2>
                <p>Roasting is an art, but also a science. And with increasing 
                    interest in specialty coffee, our perfection of the process allows 
                    us to produce beans ranging from blonde – with lighter, smoother, 
                    fruitier taste profiles to dark rich roasts with smoky, caramel and 
                    even chocolaty notes.</p>
                <p>One recent example that we're proud of is Nescafé Black Roast. Here our 
                    team worked from concept to launch in just five months, using their 
                    expertise in flavor and aroma extraction to capture an intense roast 
                    without excessive bitterness. Our strongest, darkest soluble coffee has 
                    proven a hit with consumers, and should be available in 14 markets 
                    by the end of 2020.</p>
                <p>To further expand the sensory territory, we adapt our temperature profiles 
                    to the relevant blend and coffee variety. Coffee roasting requires specialized 
                    knowledge, skills and equipment. As such, it hasn't been a viable option for 
                    many coffee shops, until now. Roastelier, our latest system innovation, 
                    simplifies the art of roasting and makes it more accessible.</p>

                <h2>Brewing the perfect cup from perfect beans</h2>
                <p>By optimizing the brewing process for soluble coffee in the factory, we're 
                    able to preserve the perfect coffee aroma, using a combination of 
                    distillation and fractionation, and return the natural aroma concentrate 
                    we obtain to the coffee we brew at the end of the process.</p>
                <p>Capsule-based coffee brings the coffee shop experience into your home. 
                    Here our latest major innovation is the <a href="https://www.nespresso.com/ch/en/vertuo-system" target="_blank">Nespresso Vertuo</a> machine system, 
                    which uses proprietary technology that combines centrifugal force and 
                    infusion to deliver a longer cup of coffee.</p>
                <p>Following the infusion phase, the machine spins the capsule at up to 7,000 rpm, 
                    faster than a propeller-driven plane's engine, to intensify the water flow 
                    through the coffee grounds, extract all the flavor and create a smooth and 
                    stable crema.</p>
                <p>In record time, we've brought the Starbucks experience into the home too, 
                    developing the<a href="https://www.nestle.com/media/pressreleases/allpressreleases/global-launch-new-starbucks-products" target="_blank">
